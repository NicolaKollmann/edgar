Documentation of a project with the SEC EDGAR database.

The Jupyter Notebook gives an overview of the database I used and the specific goal I had. However, the code can be used for all sorts of applications that require the download of information or filings from the SEC EDGAR database. This can be relevant and valuable to researchers and practioners alike.
